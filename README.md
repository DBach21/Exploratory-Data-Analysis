# Matplotlib-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

Matplotlib exploratory data analysis using the Global Superstore dataset

Exploratory data analysis assignment was based upon the following premise:

You've just been hired as a Data Analyst in Global Superstore's fast-paced Data Analytics division. You want to quickly get up to speed and learn more about your new employer. After quickly looking at the data, the following questions will be investigated:

1. Which sub category has the most orders?

2. What is the breakdown of the shipping mode?

3. Which segment nets the most profit? Based on that segment, what market yields the most profit for that segment?

Create at least 5 different types of visualizations to explore the data and to see whether it can be used to answer your questions.
